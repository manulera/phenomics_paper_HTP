* Is calcofluor the same thing as calcofluor white?
* Glycerol as carbon source with 0.1% starter glucose. Which one:
  * id: FYECO:0000138 name: glycerol YE
  
    "Experiments were performed in rich medium containing glycerol as the sole carbon source, yeast extract and other components. The concentration of glycerol is typically around 2-3% and supplemented with trace amounts of another carbon source (e.g. glucose)." [PomBase:al]

  * id: FYECO:0000252 name: + glycerol
* LiCL is the same as id: FYECO:0000093 name: + Li ions ?
* Canavanin A? The "A" I cannot find
* Glucose levels in YES and EMM
* EMM_Gly3 -> Does it have glucose at all?
* What to do with the temperature?
* sensitive to methyl methanesulfonate in glycerol carbon source? What is the control here?
* Controls / phenotypes here:
  * 0.1% glucose in media + grown for 7d + 1mM cadmium chloride
  * 0.5% glucose in media + grown for 7d 
  * 1% glucose in media + grown for 7d 
  * Grown for 7 days
  * I guess children of FYPO:0000245 (loss of viability in stationary phase) and FYPO:0001309 (increased viability in stationary phase)
